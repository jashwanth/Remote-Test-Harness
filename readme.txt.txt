This contains instructions about project execution details.
First go to the current folder through command line.
Run command line as administrator. 
First execute compile.bat file
Then run run.bat file
The resulting sequence is two concurrent clients
posting the messages and wait for their completion to
demonstarte all the requirements. Now we also have a GUI
where in we browse tp TestRequest in the current folder ,
fetch TestRequest xml document and send to testharness.
We have WPF console in the backend displaying all the sequence
of actions. We have a query box where in user inputs the string like
pass/fail/<testname> etc.. to get the log files. The button might have to
be pressed a couple of times initially before it starts working properly.
